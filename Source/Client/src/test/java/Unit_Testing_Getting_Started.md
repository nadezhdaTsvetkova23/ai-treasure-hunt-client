You can find **tutorial slides on unit testing** on Moodle. Additionally, an **example project** covering **JUnit 5** and **Mockito** is available on Moodle. This project offers in-depth guidance on writing unit tests and creating mocks.

### Unit Testing Tutorial (Highly Recommended)
A **Unit Testing tutorial** will be held, which is highly recommended to attend. It will provide further insights into writing effective tests.

### Project Setup
The project's **Gradle configuration** is already set up to work seamlessly with JUnit 5 and Mockito. You can start writing unit tests immediately without needing to modify any Gradle settings.

### When adding tests
- **Organize by Responsibility**: Respect the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). Structure your tests by creating multiple **packages**, **classes**, and **methods** as needed.
- **Follow Best Practices**: Refer to the best practices for unit testing covered in the course material and the tutorials to ensure your tests are effective and maintainable.

Happy Testing!
